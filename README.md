## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

> **"Perfect is the enemy of good, but good is the enemy of reliable."**

I build systems that:
- ✅ **Embrace failure** through OTP supervision trees
- ✅ **Scale horizontally** with stateless, concurrent architectures
- ✅ **Prioritize observability** so you know what's happening
- ✅ **Ship incrementally** because perfect code ships never
- ✅ **Document decisions** for future maintainers (including future me)

### My Engineering Principles

```elixir
defmodule Engineering.Principles do
  @principles [
    "Make it work, then make it fast (if needed)",
    "Optimize for readability - code is read 10x more than written",
    "Test the behavior, not the implementation",
    "Design for failure - systems will fail, plan for it",
    "Measure before optimizing - premature optimization kills",
    "Document the 'why', not the 'what'",
    "Ship small, ship often, ship safely",
    "Concurrency is not parallelism - understand the difference"
  ]
end
```

### 💬 Fun Fact

```elixir
# There are 10 types of people in this world:
# Those who understand binary, and those who don't.
# But there's also a third type: Those who didn't expect a ternary joke.

IO.puts("Thanks for visiting! 🚀")
